INTRODUCTION

Decompilation is reconstruction of a program in a high-level language from a program in a low-level language. Due to many reasons such as fix bugs, changing requirements, analyzing software and etc, it has motivated to decompile many low-level programs. Traditional decompilers rely on pattern matching to identify the high-level control-flow structure in a program. These decompilers try to match segments of a programâ€™s control-flow graph (CFG) to some patterns known to originate from certain control-flow structures.
